I remember pottering around on QBasic as a teenager trying to write a program
to find solutions to peg solitaire by brute force.

I never completed the project, and so this is my chance to go come back and tie
off a loose end. So far, this contains an html file that runs a script that keeps
track of human moves.

The pegSolver script will solve games with any parameters set by the user.
Or it will, very shortly! In the next few days, the html file will get the functionality
that this will allow.
